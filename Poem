I am the ocean, beautifully vast and wide,

A cradle of life, nature walk & Earth’s beating tide.

From depths unseen and unmeasured to sunshine shore,

I give you many warnings, hints and yet you ignore

My waves used to be gentle, now cry in rage,

A cruel & stormy script on a heating page.

Icebergs are weeping as they are melting away,

Their old strength is getting lost day by day.

I keep coral in my lap, who are bright and bold,

Yet I am watching them fade, their beauty old.

The fish that danced and tortoise in the streams,

Now they and their friends vanishing like forgotten dreams.

I am rising my voice ,very fierce and loud,

My petition beneath the bed & stormy shroud.

The winds are howling, the sky may weep,

Yet still, you let your promises to sleep.

I am your mirror, reflecting your trust & care,

Your actions hurting me, here there and everywhere.

Watch your action,shortsighted poor human

Fear the God, you the self-obsessed conman.

Heal my wounds otherwise face the toll,

For I am the ocean, your very own soul.

So hear my call, and my siren’s plea,

Protect the mother Earth, Protect the diverse sea.

Together, we can calm the thunder-tide,

And let the future grow, glow & rise.

And like the waves, I will fail and I will rise.,

Into a new world with new tide.

Not much stress not much sorrow,

Return my glory which you borrow.

I am calling you “O” the ocean child,

You are the hope, Always be sustainable & wild.
