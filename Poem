The Call of the Ocean 
The Place where life started : Ocean
I am the ocean, vast and wide,
A cradle of life, Earth’s beating tide.
From depths unseen to sunshine shore,
I give you warnings, yet you ignore.

My waves used to be gentle, now cry in rage,
A cruel & stormy script on a heating page.
Icebergs are weeping as they are melting away,
Their old strength is getting lost day by day.

I keep coral in my lap, who are bright and bold,
Yet I am watching them fade, their beauty old.
The fish that danced in turquoise streams
Now they are vanishing like forgotten dreams.

I am rising my voice , very fierce and loud,
A petition beneath the bed & stormy shroud.
The winds are howling, the skies may weep,
Yet still, you let your promises to sleep.

I am your mirror, reflecting your trust & care,
Your actions linger in my salty air.
Heal my wounds, or face the toll,
For I am the ocean, your very own soul.

So hear my call, and my siren’s plea,
Protect the mother Earth, protect the diverse sea.
Together, we can calm the thunder-tide,
And let the future glow & rise in hope abide.

And like the waves, I will fail and I will rise.,
Into a new world with new tide. 
Not much stress not much sorrow, 
Return my glory which you borrow. 

I am calling you “O” ocean child,
You are the hope,be sustainable & wild.
