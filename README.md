### I am the ocean, beautifully vast and wide,
### A cradle of life, nature walk &  Earth’s beating tide.
### From depths unseen and unmeasured to sunshine shore,
### I give you many warnings, hints and yet you ignore. 

The ocean is the nature's most magnificent masterpiece - a living, breathing canvas that transforms every moment with breathtaking elegance.It is immensely beauiful and characterized by the mega-biodiveristy and constituted about 71% of the water on Earth. From sunrise to sunset, its surface shifts between liquid silver, molten gold, and deep sapphire blue, creating an ever-changing landscape of mesmerizing beauty. Artistically and Scientifically the majority portion of the Earth's oceans remain a mysterious frontier, with an astonishing 80% still unexplored. This unexplored realm encompasses the deep sea, where extreme conditions pose significant challenges for exploration but various anthropogenic activites are harming our mother Earth. The nature gives us warning like unseasoned rains, unprecented floods, unexpected temprature fluactations and the sea level rise. These are the hints given to us by the ocean which we are ignoring. 

### My waves used to be gentle, now cry in rage,
### A cruel & stormy script on a heating page.
### Icebergs are weeping as they are melting away,
### Their old strength is getting lost day by day.

The ocean heart was never meant to hurt the humans but due to our deeds we are experincing unexpected results. The seawaves are meant to bring happiness and monsoon now they are changing their patterns.We can facing the pile of plastics on our sea shore which are previously dumped by humans, the changes in the seasons causing the problems to biotic components of the Earth. The ocean is warming and along with all these situtions they are affecting the ocean and the organisms inside them. The Global warming is causing the melting of the thousand years old glaciers which is causing the changes the sea level. They are threatning the whole ecosystem of the ocean. 

### I keep coral in my lap, who are bright and bold,
### Yet I am watching them fade, their beauty old.
### The fish that danced and tortoise in the streams,
### Now they and their friends vanishing like forgotten dreams.

Coral reefs are nature's most breathtaking underwater masterpieces, representing extraordinary beauty and complexity. These marine ecosystems are not just visually stunning, but also incredibly intricate living systems that embody aesthetic and ecological wonder. But due to the outcomes of the human activity the corals are being fade i.e. coral bleaching. Those were in the ocean for many many years but they are losting their beauty. The fish and tortoises are being affected, they are bring trapped in the dumped plastic, nets,straws and other garbages dumped by us in the ocean.This also effects their larva which are not getting less in number. 


### I am rising my voice ,very fierce and loud, 
### My petition beneath the bed & stormy shroud.
### The winds are howling, the sky may weep,
### Yet still, you let your promises to sleep.

The ocean is boldly saying that stop polluting me you can see the effects in front of your eyes. My petitions are kept under the bed, not being paid attention to it, I am uttering it loudly. The winds are chaning their patterns, the sky is raining with acid i.e. acid rain. Your actions are hurting me continiously. Remember that we made a mutual promise to each other.
I am the Ocean, the heart of this planet, the cradle of life itself. For billions of years, I have nurtured all living beings, offering my depths as a sanctuary and my waves as a lifeline. But now, I am crying out to you, humans—my caretakers turned destroyers. My waters are warming, my reefs are fading, and my creatures are disappearing. Your plastic suffocates me, your pollution poisons me, and your greed depletes me. I am vast, but not infinite. I am resilient, but not invincible. Save me, and you save yourselves—for without me, there is no life. Listen to my waves; they carry a plea: protect me before it's too late."


### I am your mirror, reflecting your trust & care,
### Your actions hurting me, here there and everywhere.
### Watch your action,shortsighted poor human
### Fear the God, you the self-obsessed conman. 
### Heal my wounds otherwise face the toll,
### For I am the ocean, your very own soul.

As said "Make a friend like a mirro" who can correct you on your mistake or tell you your bad actions. Humans look at me, me being your good friend, I am showing you the mirror that you are hurting everyone i.e. the Mother Nature, Mother Earth and me too.Listen up, you shortsighted, self-absorbed species! I am the Ocean, and I've had enough of your reckless behavior. You think you can keep abusing me without consequences? Think again.I've been patient. I've absorbed your pollution, your plastic, your oil spills. I've taken the heat—literally—as you pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But my patience is running out, and so is your time.If you don't act now—and I mean RIGHT NOW—to halt climate change, I'll show you what real change looks like. You think a few flooded coastlines are bad? Just wait. I can swallow entire cities. I can reshape continents. I can unleash storms that will make your worst nightmares look like a gentle breeze.Your fancy beachfront properties? Gone. Your bustling ports? Underwater. Your precious economies? Shattered.

### So hear my call, and my siren’s plea,
### Protect the mother Earth, Protect the diverse sea.
### Together, we can calm the thunder-tide,
### And let the future grow, glow & rise.

Here's a wake-up call,to the humans and humanity: I am not your dumping ground, your infinite resource, or your plaything. I am the lifeblood of this planet, and I'm sick. Sick of your ignorance, your greed, and your short-term thinking.If I am then you are.If you are protecting me, it means you are protecting yourself. Together we can stop this swarm of the events and glow our future together.The choice is yours. Act now, or prepare to face consequences beyond your wildest imagination. I am the Ocean, and this is your final warning.

### And like the waves, I will fail and I will rise.,
### Into a new world with new tide. 
### Not much stress not much sorrow, 
### Return my glory which you borrow. 

Human, the self centered species listen, I am a part of mother nature that has the capacity to balance itself and she will. She might shatter and end this world and create a new one. In that world I wil not have that much of stress and sadness which I am having in this world.  I will be happy & happy and keep other happy which will keep me happy. Happiness everywhere. You should bring me to my original avatar which I used to be not the current one. Take me back to the gentle, lovely ocean not the plastic vomiting, bleached coral or witch ocean like today. 


### I am calling you “O” the ocean child,
### You are the hope, Always be sustainable & wild. ![The Ocean Child](https://github.com/prakashaman717/The-Call-of-the-Ocean/blob/main/20250124_132928.jpg)
